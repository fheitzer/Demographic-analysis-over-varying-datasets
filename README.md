# Demographic analysis over varying datasets
Datasets are different, but in their combined knowledge lies the truth.

## Context
The application context is demographic analysis which aims at measuring the dimensions and dynamics of (human) populations. Here analysis methods have primarily been developed to study how populations of social actors can change across time through a variety of processes, such as birth, death, and migration.

There exist a number of national and international statistics organizations (e.g., ISTAT, EUROSTAT, etc.) whose major scope is to gather and study demographic data. Unfortunately, different organizations use different measuring methods. In general, this leads to different publicly available data sets containing demographic information related to different (partially overlapping) geographical regions, different time bounds, and different time granularity. Even in case of same time window and same geographical region, different data sets may contain inconsistent values for the same process (e.g., ISTAT and EUROSTAT might declare two different values for the population of Italy in 2005).
